Sub-users are users who have partial access to your server.

Sub-users allow you to give others access to your server.

## Adding a subuser

On the “Users” tab on the panel, click the “**New User**” button. You will be presented with a form to add a new user. By default, they will have full access to manage the server except for transferring it to another location or editing Docker/build settings.

Once added, the user will have accessto your server. Please note that **they must have signed up or this will not work.**
